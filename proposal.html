		<h3> My final project will be an attempt at making a clean cut portfolio. I want to have minimal animation for graphics that I design because I want to stretch my knowledge and understanding of animation. I'm thinking about integrating sass so I can add that to my list of skills. I also want to use jQuery and make some cool buttons or links that move or are attached to images that are part of the scene/background; ie. being able to click on a plant in the background and have it link to my email instead of just a contact page. </h3>
		<h3> More importantly, I want to choose a sleek way to display all of my prior and current projects that will show how I improved the project as well as what it looked like before.</h3>
		<h3> HTML/CSS and JavaScript are all things I've been working on for a long time so using jQuery and sass will give me some more creative room. </h3>
